Custom 4.x widgets built with the ArcGIS API for JavaScript.

## Components

Each component directory contains general instructions on how to use the corresponding component.

1. Info: Panel that displays customized string content in a list or paragraph form ([Sample App](https://jsapi.maps.arcgis.com/apps/InteractiveLegend/index.html?appid=c6be720af9cd4fe5a81c9016e3554fea)).

2. Screenshot: Tool which provides the capability of taking screenshots of the map view/scene view. Optionally, include the legend or pop-up with the map screenshot ([Sample App](https://jsapi.maps.arcgis.com/apps/InteractiveLegend/index.html?appid=c6be720af9cd4fe5a81c9016e3554fea)).

3. Share: Dialogue that provides the capability of sharing a web application of the current map extent across customized social sharing platforms i.e. Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or E-mail ([Sample App](https://jsapi.maps.arcgis.com/apps/Media/index.html?appid=5fd207b452cb454bac9fff9f889bcd3e)).

## Requirements

- ArcGIS API for JavaScript 4.x
- Node
- Web browser with access to the Internet
- Your favorite IDE

## Install via npm

`npm i @esri/configurable-app-components`

## Typings

Include in tsconfig.json:

`./node_modules/@esri/configurable-app-components/index.d.ts`

## Dojo config example

```
  const config = {
    async: true,
    locale: dojoLocale,
    packages: [
      {
        name: "Components",
        location: `${appPath}/node_modules/@esri/configurable-app-components`
      }
    ]
  };
```

## Importing module into project

Naming convention: `Components/[component_name]/[component_name]`

### Example:

```
import Share = require("Components/Share/Share");

import ShareItem = require("Components/Share/Share/ShareItem");
```

### Namespace

After linking the typings file to your tsconfig.json, you can use the `__esriConfigApps` namespace for the types as seen in this example.

### Adding CSS

Don't forget to link to the corresponding CSS file.

`./node_modules/@esri/configurable-app-components/[component_name]/[component_name]/css/[component_name].css`

```
<link rel="stylesheet"
    href="./node_modules/@esri/configurable-app-components/Screenshot/Screenshot/css/Screenshot.css">
```
